The following program is a 3D marching band simulator, used as my final project for CS 450 at
Oregon State University. The objective is to draw 3D objects simulating the Oregon State
University Marching Band's Take the Field 2024 show, performed prior to every halftime show.

Some simple actions within the program include:
- The left mouse button does rotation
- The middle mouse button does scaling
- 0: Switch to camera focusing on the center of the field
- 1: Switch to camera focusing on the field from the front sideline
- 2: Switch to camera focusing on the field from a birds-eye view
- 3: Switch to camera focusing on the field from the box
  (the "box" is a term used for the uppermost part of the stands)
- F/Space: Pause/Unpause the animation
